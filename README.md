Project 1 for Embedded Systems
For this project I forst created the BNF notation for the Library Numpy. The initial goal was to create a way for me to augment and record the memory between numpy and regular python. The system was able to pass my tests for whether or not I could read through cases. Bu twhen it came to the algorithms part it did not work.
