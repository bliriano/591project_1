Project 1 for Embedded Systems
For this project I forst created the BNF notation for the Library Numpy. The initial goal was to create a way for me to augment and record the memory between numpy and regular python. The system was able to pass my tests for whether or not I could read through cases. Bu twhen it came to the algorithms part it did not work. What I planned to do was to also see how much memory I could reallocate to optomize the memory storage since numpy uses an object type to hold information but not a list like regular python.
